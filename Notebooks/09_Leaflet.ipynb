In the past, most digital geographic information was confined to specialized software on desktop PCs and could not be easily shared. With the advent of web mapping, geographical information can be shared, visualized, and edited in the browser. The most important advantage to this is accessibility: a web map, just like any website, can be reached by anyone from any device that has an internet browser and an internet connection.\n","\n","Web maps are interactive. The term interactive implies that the viewer can interact with the map. This can mean selecting different map data layers or features to view, zooming into a particular part of the map that you are interested in, inspecting feature properties, editing existing content, or submitting new content, and so on.\n","\n","Web maps are also said to be powered by the web, rather than just digital maps on the web. This means that the map is usually not self-contained; in other words, it depends on the internet. At least some of the content displayed on a web maps is usually loaded from other locations on the web, such as a tile server (Section 6.5.6.2).\n","\n","Web maps are useful for various purposes, such as data visualization in journalism (and elsewhere), displaying real-time spatial data, powering spatial queries in online catalogs and search tools, providing computational tools, reporting, and collaborative mapping"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kY3viyI3gnyG"},"source":["## HTML & CSS\n","Intro a Hypertex Markup Languaje ([HTML](https://web-mapping.surge.sh/html.html)), Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS](https://web-mapping.surge.sh/css.html)) y JavaScript ([JS](https://web-mapping.surge.sh/javascript-basics.html))."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Mj5mwm5FgnyH"},"source":["## Leaflet\n","Leaflet (Crickard III 2014) is an open-source JavaScript library for building interactive web maps.
