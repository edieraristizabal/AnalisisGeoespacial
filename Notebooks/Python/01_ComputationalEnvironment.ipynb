    "Python is extremely useful language to learn in terms of GIS since many (or most) of the different GIS Software packages (such as ArcGIS, QGIS, PostGIS etc.) provide an interface to do analysis using Python scripting. During this course, we will mostly focus on doing Geospatial analysis without any third party softwares such as ArcGIS. Why? There are several reasons for doing it using Python without any additional software:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Everything is free: you don’t need to buy and expensive license for ArcGIS (for example)\n",
    "* You will learn and understand much more deeply how different geoprocessing operations work\n",
    "* Python is highly efficient: used for analysing Big Data\n",
    "* Python is highly flexible: supports all data formats that you can imagine\n",
    "*  Using Python (or any other open-source programming language) supports open source softwares/codes and open science by making it possible for everyone to reproduce your work, free-of-charge.\n",
    "* Plug-in and chain different third-party softwares to build e.g. a fancy web-GIS applications as you want (using e.g. GeoDjango with PostGIS as a back-end)\n",
    "\n",
    "This course uses Python because it has emerged as one of the main and most solid options for Data Science, together with other free alternatives such as R. Python is widely used for data processing and analysis both in academia and in industry. There is a vibrant and growing scientific community, working at both universities and companies, that supports and enhances its capabilities for data analysis by providing new and refining existing extensions (a.ka.a. libraries, see below). In the geospatial world, Python is also very widely adopted, being the selected language for scripting in both [ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis) and [QGIS](http://qgis.org). All of this means that, whether you are thinking of continuing in Higher Education or trying to find a job in industry, Python will be an importan asset that employers will significantly value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a high-level language means that the code can be \"dynamically interpreted\", which means it is run on-the-fly without the need to be compiled. This is in contrast to \"low-level\" programming languages, which first need to be converted into machine code (i.e. compiled) before they can be run. With Python, one does not need to worry about compilation and can just write code, evaluate, fix it, re-evaluate it, etc. in a quick cycle, making it a very productive tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most popular distributions are [**Anaconda** and **Miniconda**](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda). **Anaconda** is an open source Python distribution that is purpose built for data science, machine learning, and large-scale data processing. It includes the core Python language, over 1,500 data science packages, a package management system called conda, IPython (an interactive Python interpreter), and much more. While it is a very comprehensive distribution, it is also quite large and therefore can take a while to download and consumes a lot of disk space. **Miniconda** on the other hand, is a slimmed down version of Anaconda and includes all of the same components except for the pre-installed 1,500 data science packages. Instead, we can simply install these packages individually as needed using conda (the Anaconda/Miniconda package manager).\n",

    "## Starting Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "The main computational tool you will be using during this course is [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Lab is an interactive web interface for code development, which follows the concept known as REPL (Read — Evaluate — Print — Loop), that is widely used by data scientists. The great advantage of using a REPL environment is that we can develop our code in a gradual manner, executing command by command and checking its results. Additionally, we can keep explanatory text together with the code that we are going to develop and also view the results, all in the same environment without need to alternate between the command line and other applications, such as image viewer or others. Notebooks are a convenient way to thread text, code and the output it produces in a single file that you can then share, edit and modify. You can think of notebooks as the Word document of Data Scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook comprises a single file that stores narrative text, computer code, and the output produced by code. Storing both narrative and computational work in a single file means that the entire workflow can be recorded and documented in the same place, without having to resort to ancillary devices (like a paper notebook). A second feature of notebooks is that they allow for interactive work. Modern computational work benefits from the ability to try, fail, tinker, and iterate quickly until a working solution is found. Notebooks embody this quality and enable the user to work interactively. Whether the computation takes place on a laptop or on a data center, notebooks provide the same interface for interactive computing, lowering the cognitive load require to scale up. Third, notebooks have interoperability built in. The notebook format is designed for recording and sharing computational work, but not necessarily for other stages of the research cycle. To widen the range of possibilities and applications, notebooks are designed to be easily convertible into other formats. For example, while a specific application is required to open and edit most notebook file formats, no additional software is required to convert them into pdf files that can be read, printed, and annotated without the need of technical software.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is a plain text file with the **.ipynb** extension, which means that it is an easy file to move around, sync, and track over time. Internally, it is structured as a plain-text document containing JavaScript Object Notation that records the state of the notebook, so they also integrate well with a host of modern web technologies. The atomic element that makes up a notebook is called a cell. Cells are consistent chunks of content that contain either text or code. In fact, a notebook can be thought of as an ordered collection of cells. Cells can be of two types: text and code."

    "\n",
    "Containers are a lightweight version of a virtual machine, which is a program that enables an entire operating system to run compartimentalised on top of another operating system. Containers allow to encapsulate an entire environment (or platform) in a format that is easy to transfer and reproduce in a variety of computational contexts. The most popular technology for containers nowadays is Docker, and the opportunities that it provides to build transparent and transferrable infrastructure for data science are starting to be explored.\n",

    "Docker allows us to create a \"container\" that includes all the tools required to access the content of the book interactively. But, what exactly is a container? There are several ways to describe it, from very technical to more intuitive ones. In this context, we will focus on a general understanding rather than on the technical details behind its magic. One can think of a container as, well, a \"box\" that includes everything that is required to run a certain set of software. This box can be moved around, from machine to machine, and the computations it executes will remain exactly the same. In fact, the content of the box remains exactly the same, bit by bit. When we download a container into a computer, be it a laptop or a data center, we are not performing an install of the software it contains from the usual channels, for the platform on which we are going to run it on. Instead, we are downloading the software in the form that was installed when the container was originally built and packaged, and for the operating system that was also packaged originally. This is the real advantage: build once, run everywhere. For the experienced reader, this might sound very much like their older syster: virtual machines. Although there are similarities between both technologies, containers are more lightweight and can be run much more swiftly than virtual machines. This box that is isolated interacts with the rest of the computer through several links that connect the two. In the case of this book, since JupyterLab is a client-server application, the server runs inside the container and we connect to it through two main \"doors\": one, through the browser, we will access the main Lab interface; and two, we will \"mount\" a folder inside the container so we can use software inside the container to edit files that are stored outside in the host machine.\n",

    "This is the recommended approach if you meet the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] You have admin rights over your machine\n",
    "- [x] You are running either Windows 10 Pro, macOS, or Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, Docker is the preferred alternative. It provides a stable platform to run complex software setups like that required in this context. Docker is a containerisation technology that allows to run pre-packaged (containerised) software under controlled environments. Relying on [Docker](https://github.com/darribas/gds_env), the gds_env project provides a containerised platform for Geographic Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to install this (given you meet the requirements above) include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain a copy of Docker and install it:\n",
    "    - Windows10 Pro/Enterprise: Install Docker Desktop for Windows\n",
    "    - macOS: Get started with Docker Desktop for Mac\n",
    "- Open a terminal or shell. How to do this will depend on your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Windows: we recommend PowerShell. Type \"PowerShell\" on the startup menu and, when it comes up, hit enter. This will open a terminal for you.\n",
    "    - macOS: use the Teminal.app. You can find it on the Applications folder, within the Utilities subfolder.\n",
    "    - Linux: if you are running Linux, you probably already have a terminal application of preference. Almost any Linux distribution comes with a terminal or shell app built in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Download, or \"pull\", our [container](https://hub.docker.com/r/darribas/gds/). For this run on the terminal the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://geekflare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/docker-hub-repo.png\" width=\"1000\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  docker pull darribas/gds:3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the command above has finished installing your GDS stack, you are ready to go! To get a Jupyter session started, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "     - Run on the same terminal as above the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " docker run --rm -ti -p 8888:8888 -v {PWD}:/home/jovyan/work darribas/gds:3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "- docker run: Docker does a lot of things, to communicate that we want to run a new container, we need specify it.\n",
    "- --rm: this flag will ensure the container is removed when you close it. This in turn makes sure every time you run it again, you start afresh with the exact same set up.\n",
    "- ti: this flag further ensures that the container is not run in the background but in an _i_nteractive mode.\n",
    "- p 8888:8888: with this, we ensure we forward the port from inside the container out to the host machine (i.e. your laptop). This step is crucial because it allows us to interact with the server and for Jupyter to \"send\" JupyterLab across so we can access it in our web browser.\n",
    "- v {PWD}:/home/jovyan/work: similarly, this flag \"mounts\" the folder from where the command is being run in the terminal ({PWD}) into the container so it is visible and editable from inside the container. Such folder will be available at the container's work folder.\n",
    "- gdsbook/stack: finally, we also need to specify which image we want to run. In this case, we run the image created for this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start a Python session, please do not quite the window until you are done using Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Open your favorite browser (preferably Firefox or Chrome) and point it to localhost:8888\n",
    "    - You will be asked for a password or a token. To access the lab, copy the token from the terminal (in the example above, that would be ae7e8017f3e97658a218ec2c2d1fbcc894f09d80f6b5f79c), enter it on the box and click on \"Log in\". Now you are in!\n",

The motivation is that, so far, we have only seen how you can create Python code that, if you want to run again somewhere else, you need to copy and paste entirely. However, as we will see in more detail later in the course, one of the main reasons why you want to use Python for data analysis, instead of a point-and-click graphical interface like SPSS, for instance, is that you can easily reuse code and re-run analyses easily. Methods help us accomplish this by encapsulating snippets of code that perform a particular task and making them available to be called.\n",

Above the editor are buttons to save the current script, run it, and clear the map. The Get Link button generates a unique URL for the script in the address bar. The map in the bottom panel contains the layers added by the script. At the top is a search box for datasets and places. The left panel contains code examples, your saved scripts, a searchable API reference and an asset manager for private data. The right panel has an inspector for querying the map, an output console, and a manager for long-running tasks. The help button help in the upper right contains links to this Guide and other resources for getting help. Learn more from the [Code Editor guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Open the Earth Engine Code Editor here: [code.earthengine.google.com](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). If you have not already, you will need to enable access by logging in using a registered Google account.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the Scripts tab located on the far left of the Code Editor. There you will find a collection of example scripts that access, display, and analyze Earth Engine data.\n",
    "3. Under “Image Collection,” select the “Filtered Composite” example. You will see a script appear in the center console. Press the Run button to execute the 4. script. The Filtered Composite example selects Landsat 7 images that intersect or are within the boundaries of Colorado and Utah. It then displays a true color composite of the selected images. The samples introduce you to commonly used methods, such as filter(), clip(), and Map.addLayer().\n",

    "The Code Editor has a variety of features to help you take advantage of the Earth Engine API. View example scripts or save your own scripts on the Scripts tab. Query objects placed on the map with the Inspector tab. Display and chart numeric results using the Google Visualization API. Share a unique URL to your script with collaborators and friends with the Get Link button. Scripts you develop in the Code Editor are sent to Google for processing and the generated map tiles and/or messages are sent back for display in the Map and/or Console tab. All you need to run the Code Editor is a web browser (use Google Chrome for best results) and an internet connection. The following sections describe elements of the Earth Engine Code Editor in more detail."

Before installing, however, make a conda environment specifically for Earth Engine. Installing the Earth Engine API to its own environment ensures that it and its dependent packages will not cause versioning issues with your base environment or any other environment you've previously set up and vice versa. For more information on managing conda environments, please visit this [site](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html).\n",

You simply go to your area of interest, select your desired time range and cloud coverage, and inspect the resulting data in the browser. Try out different visualizations or make your own, download high resolution images and create timelapses. Satelite imagery in EO Browser can be visualized based on user's desired configuration. There are already several visualizations with legends and descriptions prepared for you, such as true color, false color, NDVI, EVI, etc. By choosing Custom it is possible to choose any combination of bands and make a composite by simply drag and dropping the bands into the RGB channels. The index tool makes it possible to quickly create remote sensing indices and control the visualization, by drag and dropping bands into the equation. The custom script functionality is a powerful tool for visualizing satellite data. Using Javascript, you have full control over your visualization, allowing you to make computations, logical operators and conditions, data fusion, multitemporal scripting, etc. Additionally, you can modify your image by editing the strength of the three color channels, contrast (gain) and luminance (gamma) in the effects pannel.\n",
